# T-shirt Designer

A simple not-entirely-functional t-shirt designer webapp made for the course Browser Technologies at the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam. The main purpose of this webapp is to demonstrate the use of progressive enhancement. To create something can can remain mostly functional when it's only html, html/css and so on.

<br>

## Live demo

You can find a live demo of this webapp [here](https://sasjakoning.github.io/t-shirt-designer/).

## Installation

This webapp is made using pure vanilla html/css and Javascript. To run it, you can simply open the index.html file in your browser.

## Process

Below you will find my process of creating this webapp. I will explain the choices I made and why I made them. I'll also include feedback sessions and the changes I made based on the feedback. I will be doing these on a weekly basis.

## Week 1

In the first week of this project I received the briefing. The goal of this project is to create a demo based on a chosen user story. I have to make sure the demo is usable (for atleast it's core functionality) by all users, on all browsers and in all contexts.

The demo should be build in three layers following the principles of progressive enhancement.

During this project it's not allowed to use polyfills and NPM packages. It is allowed to use server side rendering but not required.

### User Story

The user story I chose is the following:

> As a user I want to be able to design, save and order a nerdy t-shirt (with text and images). I also want to be able to continue where I left off when I come back to the site.

<br>

<!-- TOC --><a name="requirements"></a>
### Requirements

The requirements for this project are the following:

- User info (Name, phone number or email)
- Color of the t-shirt
- Text on the t-shirt
- Size of the t-shirt
- Male/female t-shirt
- Image on the t-shirt (or behind the shirt to compare)
- Continue where you left off, review t-shirt design.
- Validation, everything needs to be filled in, show clear error messages.
- User should be able to create multiple designs and review them. There should be an overview page.
- There should be an order page where the user can order the t-shirt.

Because the project will be a demo, Actually ordering the shirt doesn't have to be entirely functional.

### Core functionality

The core functionality of this project is the ability to design a t-shirt. This means the user should be able to choose a color, add text, add an image and choose a size. The user should also be able to order the design.

### Flowchart

To get a better understanding of the flow of the webapp I made a flowchart. This flowchart shows the different steps the user will take to create a t-shirt design.

### Feedback session 1

The first feedback session of this project was held friday 24/03/2023. During this session I showed my progress so far with the flowchart and base html. I was told I was well on my way and that I should continue working the way I am now.
